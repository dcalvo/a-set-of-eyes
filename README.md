# A Set of Eyes (ASoE)
A Set of Eyes, or ASoE, is a screen reader that uses computer vision to ensure 100% web accessibility. Our mission is to democratize screen-reader technology in order to empower the visually-impaired.

## Problem
Screen readers are both overly simplistic and use non-intuitive interfaces, while also being limited to the developer’s understanding on how to make a web page accessible. Websites/applications may leave accessibility to the last phase of implementation which lends itself to poor accessibility designs. Also, right now, learning how to use a screen reader requires extensive amounts of learning/training, which presents a learning curve.

## Solution Presented by ASoE
Our solution leverages computer vision to democratize the screen reader user experience so that users are not at the mercy of developers whenever they’re using a computer.

All screen readers operating on the Microsoft Windows OS must use Microsoft UI Automation and IAccessible2 in order to perform their functionality. Microsoft is closing these APIs next year, thereby drastically limiting the ability for third-party screen readers to operate. Our AI-powered screen reader uses computer vision to directly view the screen and bypass this requirement.

We will also want to provide a more intuitive interface that doesn’t require a user to remember a plethora of commands.
